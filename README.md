Bare-bones plugin to add 'read more' links to long metadata fields in Omeka

Easy-peasy effort to address desire to have a 'read more' link on long descriptions on metadata in Omeka: http://omeka.org/forums/topic/continue-reading-tag?replies=3#post-75435

No fanciness for configuration or choosing which fields get the read more link. Just Dublin Core Description gets trimmed to 200 characters with the link.
